<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">While I can hardly claim to be an expert, I found running in Australia very different to New Zealand, the main reason being that it is often really hot! I usually wouldn't consider taking water with me for only a few kilometres but over here, it is pretty much a necessity. However, running can be a very good method of sightseeing and while in Sydney I ended up running for an hour and half around the CBD (which was not a particularly wise idea at lunch rush hour!) and waterfront, taking in the Harbour Bridge, Opera House and Botanic Gardens. During my stay in Melbourne, I took a similar touristy run through Federation Square, along the banks of the Yarra and back via the Southbank.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">A few weeks later, while in Cairns I spent a very hot half hour run along the lagoon looking for crocodiles, a bit of a change from running in the UK! Disappointed not to have spotted one (although I'm not sure what I would have done if I had actually seen one!), I turned around and made my way back, about to expire in the humid early evening heat with the tide coming in over the mud flats.</p>
